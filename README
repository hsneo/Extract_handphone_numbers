2011-06-21  Hock Sik   To develop bash script to clean up phone numbers and extract only 
                       handphone numbers


Introduction.
*************
This script reads an input file containing both phone numbers and handphone numbers.
It cleans up phone numbers by validating phone numbers using regexp: 
a) Check on the first few characters (065, +065, (65), (065). etc) and substitute them with no space
b) Extract and output handphone numbers to a valid file if their lengths are equal to 8 characters
c) Otherwise, output the rest to an invalid file

Finally, sort out by phone numbers in the invalid and valid files.

Count and show the number of records in these files. 

Running script
**************
use chmod 755 to make the script executable. Execute it by typing "./filterScript_handphone.
